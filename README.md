Device tree for the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 (p839v55)
# A device tree tells the Android build system how to build for a certain device.

### This project is mostly dead due to a lack of interest. However, should you wish to work on it, do the following:
1: Create a local manifest and add this repo to it.
2: Add 'p839v55' to your breakfast if it dosen't show up automatically after running 'repo-sync'

### This will not build.
